The folder `mice_synthesizing` contains the simulation studies of interest, and includes a ReadMe file of its own, to guide the reader through any work produced in this folder. The `synthpop_synthesizing` folders contains a number of files related to simulations concerning synthesizing data with `synthpop`, but these are not of interest in the project anymore. The folder `gerko` contains some files that are used to assess how to obtain confidence valid variance estimates from bootstrapped data.
